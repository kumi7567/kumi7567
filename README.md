Hi, I'm Sergio Garcia (sh4d0w), a recent graduate student in Network Operating Systems Administration (ASIR). My path in systems administration led me to an exciting discovery: cybersecurity. Since then, I have dedicated myself to training and facing challenges to learn new technologies and strengthen my understanding of this exciting field.<br><br>During my studies, I had the opportunity to gain experience in different areas of cybersecurity. I performed web audits, OSINT investigations, internal audits and code analysis which led me to become much more interested in the Red Team field. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of the importance of protecting systems and data properly.<br><br>In addition, I have worked as a system administrator, creating and managing an Active Directory environment (Windows + Linux) creating 4 subnets thanks to OpenWrt for a correct and secure operation. I have also installed multiple services with Docker (Gophish, Mailcow, Rancher...). This experience has given me a solid foundation in IT infrastructure management.<br><br>Programming is another passion of mine, and I enjoy creating scripts and tools for multiple tasks. My preferred programming languages include Python, Bash and Powershell.<br><br>Finally, I have a website where I publish content related to programming, cybersecurity, solving CTFs, etc.
